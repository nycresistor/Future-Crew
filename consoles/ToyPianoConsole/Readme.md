It's the toy piano that Shelby found in the street, wired up so 
each of its keys can transmit either a keyboard press or
a MIDI note. See teensyduino code for key mapping.

So far, it can only send keypresses.  It has no lights, meters, etc. 

futurecrew_toypiano is the teensyduino sketch.  It requires the bounce library
from http://playground.arduino.cc/code/bounce
